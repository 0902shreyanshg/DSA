// Inline function

// When the program executes the function call instruction the CPU stores the memory address of the 
// instruction following the function call, copies the arguments of the function on the stack and 
// finally transfers control to the specified function. The CPU then executes the function code, 
// stores the function return value in a predefined memory location/register and returns control to the 
// calling function. This can become overhead if the execution time of function is less than the switching 
// time from the caller function to called function (callee). For functions that are large and/or perform 
// complex tasks, the overhead of the function call is usually insignificant compared to the amount of time 
// the function takes to run. However, for small, commonly-used functions, the time needed to make the 
// function call is often a lot more than the time needed to actually execute the functionâ€™s code. 
// This overhead occurs for small functions because execution time of small function is less than the 
// switching time.

// C++ provides an inline functions to reduce the function call overhead. Inline function is a function that 
// is expanded in line when it is called. When the inline function is called whole code of the inline function 
// gets inserted or substituted at the point of inline function call. This substitution is performed by 
// the C++ compiler at compile time. Inline function may increase efficiency if it is small.
